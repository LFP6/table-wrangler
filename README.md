# table-wrangler
jQuery Plugin for sorting and filtering tables

This is still a very much work in progress, and has some particular limitations. However, it should generally be usable (See the doc on the plugin in /src/table-wrangler.js) Documentation, tests, npm integration, webpack, etc. are incoming, as well as some other customizations (like jQueryUI option instead of bootstrap, full-screen options instead of popovers, and column sorting) If you're interested, feel free to watch the repository, submit a PR with changes, or submit an issue with any questions/bugs/requests.
