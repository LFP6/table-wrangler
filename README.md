# table-wrangler
jQuery Plugin for sorting and filtering tables

~~This is still a very much work in progress, and has some particular limitations. However, it should generally be usable (See the doc on the plugin in /src/table-wrangler.js) Documentation, tests, npm integration, webpack, etc. are incoming, as well as some other customizations (like jQueryUI option instead of bootstrap, full-screen options instead of popovers, and column sorting) If you're interested, feel free to watch the repository, submit a PR with changes, or submit an issue with any questions/bugs/requests.~~

I've opted not to work on this, as I've stopped using the imperative jQuery approach in lieu of MV* (pecifically Vue.js). All content is as-is, though I can answer any questions, and this repo may be taken down at some point in the future.
